# Contribute to react-datetime

Hey!! So good you are interested in collaborate with react-datetime, I'm pretty sure you can make the difference here!

react-datetime is a nice choice if you are looking for some open-source project to lay your hands on. It's a library **used by thousands of developers**, and the changes in the last version make easier for everyone to understand it. It's not simple, but it's small enough to be get you initiated in a couple of hours.

## Do you want to be part of the future of react-datetime?
We've just released the version 3 of the library and we are already planning the version 4, why don't you join the conversation and help defining the roadmap:

* [Defining version 4 of react-datetime](https://github.com/arqex/react-datetime/issues/723)

## Do you want to play with the source code?
Best way of understand anything is by experiencing it! This repository includes a playground to let you make changes to the library in minutes. Clone the repo and fire up the playground:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arqex/react-datetime.git
cd react-datetime
npm install
npm run playground
```
This will start a local development server building `src/index.js`. We can update react-datetime's sources then and our changes will be hot loaded by the development server.
